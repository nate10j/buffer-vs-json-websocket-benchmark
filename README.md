# binary-vs-json-benchmark-test

I wrote a small [article](https://hjkl11.hashnode.dev/performance-analysis-of-json-buffer-custom-binary-protocol-protobuf-and-messagepack-for-websockets) on this (might be bad)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.6. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
